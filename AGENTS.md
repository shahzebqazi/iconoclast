# Repository guide (contributors & automation)

Human-facing introduction: **[README.md](README.md)**. This file is for **people and tools** changing the repo: layout, hosting, and follow-up tasks.

## Handoff — 2026-05-14

- **About (was Ritual):** Canonical route is **`/about/`** (`site/about/index.html`). The **`site/ritual/`** tree was removed; external links to **`/ritual/`** 404 unless you add a redirect stub later. Nav label everywhere is **About**.
- **Rates:** `site/rates/index.html` uses **`body.page-art.rates-menu-page`** — fine-dining–style menu (cream paper, serif, dot leaders); **wide** viewports show **EN | FR** columns; **narrow** viewports use an **EN / FR** toggle. Listed prices are **USD**; Canadian **CAD** parity is one footnote in the English column. Copy is still checked by **`npm run verify:public`** (required rate substrings must appear somewhere in the file).
- **Verify:** `scripts/verifyPublicSite.mjs` **`publicPages`** list includes **`site/about/index.html`** (not `ritual`). Global forbidden patterns still block visible **GitHub** mentions and `github.com` links on *most* pages; if you re-add GitHub on Links, restore per-file **`skipFiles`** on those patterns (see git history around 2026-05-14).
- **Session Bassist VST:** `site/session-bassist-vst/index.html` is a short offline stub; not linked from primary nav.
- **CSS:** `site/style.css` — look for **`about-service-tags`**, **`rates-menu-page`**, and existing **`page-art` / `theme-invert` / `links-page`** blocks before editing layout.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `site/` | **Public website** — source for what GitHub Pages publishes; **`site/index.html`** is **`https://iconoclastaud.io/`** |
| `site/about/index.html` | **About** — bio, ethos, service tags (dark `theme-invert` skin). Replaces former **`/ritual/`** page. |
| `site/rates/index.html` | **Rates** — `page-art` + **`rates-menu-page`** (cream “menu” layout); pricing copy must satisfy **`npm run verify:public`**. |
| `site/.nojekyll` | Disables Jekyll when building from this folder |
| `site/public/generated/` | **Generated public assets** — `npm run assets:build`; files are served under **`/public/generated/…`** |
| `CNAME` | Copied into **`site/`** by the workflow — custom domain `iconoclastaud.io` |
| `assets/readme-banner.svg` | Glass-style banner for the GitHub README only |
| `assets/readme-oni-mask.png` | Copy of `site/public/generated/icons/oni-mask-128.png` for README (favicon / brand glyph) |
| `README.md` | GitHub repo landing (not rendered as the live homepage) |
| `docs/` | Markdown sources; not the static site |
| `docs/executive-summary.md` | Longer narrative and product alignment |
| `docs/agent-prompt-typescript-github-pages.md` | Prompt for a future TypeScript slice (replace `OWNER/REPO`) |
| `docs/agent-prompt-site-ux.md` | Prompt for layout/CSS refactors on the public site |
| `docs/agent-prompt-normalize-site-structure.md` | **Spec + agent prompt:** dedupe HTML across routes (templates / small static build); read before large IA changes |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | Runs `npm run assets:build`, copies `CNAME` into `site/`, then deploys **`site/`** as the Pages artifact |

## GitHub Pages (canonical URL)

**Live homepage:** **`https://iconoclastaud.io/`** — contents of repo **`site/`** are published at the **domain root**. Older **`/site/…`** URL paths from a previous deploy layout are **deprecated**; do not document marketing URLs as `…/site/…`. The old **`/ritual/`** path was renamed to **`/about/`**; bookmarks to **`/ritual/`** need a redirect if you still need them.

**Project URL:** **`https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`** — same: **`site/`** is the site root for the project Pages URL.

1. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment** → **Source: GitHub Actions**
2. **Custom domain:** `iconoclastaud.io` (DNS per GitHub docs)
3. Workflow: **`npm ci`**, **`npm run assets:build`**, copy **`CNAME`** into **`site/`**, ensure **`site/.nojekyll`**, upload **`site/`** as the artifact

**First-time setup:** After the workflow exists on `main`, GitHub may prompt once to approve the `github-pages` environment.

**Editing:** change files under **`site/`**; push to **`main`**.

## Next implementation slice

- **TypeScript / build:** [docs/agent-prompt-typescript-github-pages.md](docs/agent-prompt-typescript-github-pages.md)
- **Layout / responsiveness / visual structure:** [docs/agent-prompt-site-ux.md](docs/agent-prompt-site-ux.md)
- **Normalize structure (shared templates, less duplicated HTML):** read **[docs/agent-prompt-normalize-site-structure.md](docs/agent-prompt-normalize-site-structure.md)** — spec for hosting/URLs plus the agent task for refactoring.

## Backlog — bugs and changes

**Workflow:** Log items here as they are identified. **Do not implement** fixes until this file is updated to say implementation is started (or a separate go-ahead is given).

**Repo scan (ad hoc):** No `TODO` / `FIXME` markers were found in tracked `*.md`, `*.html`, `*.css`, `*.js`, `*.ts`, `*.json`, `*.yml` files at the time this section was added.

| ID | Type | Description | Notes |
|----|------|-------------|-------|
| README-1 | change | README hero and structure | Addressed: single primary wordmark (`wordmark-dark-bg.svg` for GitHub), one logo row table, split About/sitemap, table headers, footer tone. |

## GitHub — commit when a feature works

When a **feature (or fix) is implemented and verified working**, do not stop at a green local tree only: **commit and push to GitHub** as part of the same session, unless the user explicitly asked not to push or there is no `git` remote / credentials (then say so and stop).

1. **Verify** using commands that match the change (at minimum **`npm run verify:public`** for edits under **`site/`**; run **`npm test`** or other scripts if the task touched them).
2. **Commit** with a clear message: what changed and why, one logical change set per commit when practical.
3. **Push** to the tracked remote (typically **`origin`**) on the branch you are on — usually **`main`** for this repo’s Pages flow. Prefer a normal push; do not **force-push** or rewrite published history unless the user explicitly requests it.

If verification fails, fix first, then commit and push. If you cannot push (auth, branch protection, merge conflicts), report the exact error and leave the commit ready locally.

## Conventions

- Public-safe content only; no secrets in commits.
- Prefer matching tone with [docs/executive-summary.md](docs/executive-summary.md) (direct, technical, WIP-friendly).
- **Dev-only gallery/design docs:** `npm run assets:gallery` may create `site/public/index.html` locally. Do not link it from public pages; the Pages workflow removes it and `site/design/` before deploy.
- **Site CSS:** `site/style.css` — flat layout, Bauhaus palette tokens (`--bg`, `--rose-gold`, `--baby-blue`, etc.). Avoid glass/backdrop-filter, card stacks, and heavy shadows on user-facing pages; use borders and section spacing instead.
- **Agent prompts** (`docs/agent-prompt-*.md`): each file is a **disposable task spec**. When the described work is done and merged, **delete that prompt file** and remove its row from the layout table and links in this file so the repo does not accumulate stale instructions.
